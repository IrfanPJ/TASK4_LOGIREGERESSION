 Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

This project implements a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. The goal is to predict a binary outcome (0 or 1) based on input features.

 Steps

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Preprocessing**: The target variable is converted into binary values (0 and 1).
3. **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training and testing sets (80/20).
4. **Feature Scaling**: Features are standardized for better model performance.
5. **Model Training**: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score.
7. **Threshold Tuning**: The classification threshold is adjusted to see how it affects the model's performance.

 Evaluation Metrics

- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between classes.
